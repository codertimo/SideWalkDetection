In this paper, we present a method which can detect sidewalks based on line detection. The main function of it is that induce pedestrians to follow right ways to across sidewalks. Most sidewalk detection algorithms use color histogram analysis to extract the area of sidewalk. However, our algorithm is based on the line detection because there are various kinds of patterns and colors used in detecting sidewalks all over the world. We applied some image filters that get derivatives of images and calculating line with some regression methods. It is performed using a Walking Assistance Mobile Application for visually impaired people and can be used in no extra device and technology.
