# SideWalk Detection Algorithm

#### Sidewalk Detection Algorithm based on Line Detection

Existing Sidewalk Detection Algorithms are based on Color Histogram. They find frames which color is gray and reconized those parts are the sidewalk. However if the sidewalk's color is not gray or has a lot of pattern, algorithm coudn't works.

So we found the other way to detect sidewalks. It's **Line Detection** and **Vanishing Point**. Using those features, we could detect the sidewalk more efficiently.
